                Ned was a very good cook, and his specialty was frozen pizza. If you were lucky, you could snag a
                slice fresh out of the oven, but only around midnight.
                Ned was very shy and preferred his Xbox over people.</p>

            <div class="book-page"> <p class="book-text">One day Ned decided he was going to overcome his shyness, so he signed up for Tinder, Mutual and even
                Bumble. You see Ned was quite desperate (if you couldn&#39;t tell). Though initially
                nervous, he decided he was going to put himself out there and break out of his while (playing-Xbox-being-single-forever infinite) loop.</p>

                match! Her name was Cindy, a communications major from Nampa, Idaho. Ned and Cindy had
                many things in common. They were the same age, liked similar music, and both thought Dota was better than League of Legends. Cindy was even was
                a great cook (though she actually was, whereas Ned just thought he was). </p>

            <div class="book-page"><p class="book-text">Ned finally built up the courage to ask her out, and they went on their first date to the
                Nicklecade. It was going really well until Ned realized he had a lab due for 240! What was he
                going to do??? He panicked and told Cindy he had to go because he was feeling sick. He then
                stayed up all night trying to finish. Ned scheduled another date with Cindy, but then realized he had
                a Linear Algebra test the next day! He had to cancel on her again! Poor Cindyâ€¦ How was Ned going to
                make it up to her??? Ned then realized that he had to do, if he wanted to be eternally happy. </p>
