                He was a very good cook, his specialty was frozen Pizza and if you were lucky you could snag a
                slice fresh out of the oven, but only around 12 am.
                Ned was very shy and preferred his Xbox rather than people.</p>

                Bumble. You see Ned was quite desperate (if you couldn&#39;t tell) but it also made Ned quite
                nervous, but he decided he was going to put himself out there and get out of his while (playing
                x-box be single loop).</p>

                match! Her name was Cindy, a communications major from Nampa Idaho. Ned and Cindy had
                many things in common, they both loved League of Legends, were the same age, and Cindy was
                a great cook (She actually was whereas Ned just thought he was). </p>

                Nicklecade. It was going really well until Ned realized he had a lab due for 240! What was he
                going to do??? He panicked and told Cindy he had to go because he was feeling sick. He then
                was up all night trying to finish. He scheduled another date with Cindy but then realized he had
                a Calculus test the next day! He had to cancel on her again! Poor Cindy… How was Ned going to
                make it up to her??? Ned realized if he wanted to be happy he would have to change his
                major…</p>
