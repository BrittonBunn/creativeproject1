        </div>
        <div class="cover"></div>
        <div class="book-page"> There once was a CS student named Ned, he studied hard but gamed even harder.
            He was a very good cook, his specialty was frozen Pizza and if you were lucky you could snag a
            slice fresh out of the oven, but only around 12 am.
            Ned was very shy and preferred his Xbox rather than people.</div>
        <div class="book-page"></div>
        <div class="book-page"> One day Ned decided he was going to change that so he signed up for Tinder, Mutual and even
            Bumble. You see Ned was quite desperate (if you couldn&#39;t tell) but it also made Ned quite
            nervous, but he decided he was going to put himself out there and get out of his while (playing
            x-box be single loop).</div>
        <div class="book-page"></div>
        <div class="book-page"> The next day, after a late night of finishing his 3D maze lab for CS 235, his phone buzzed with a
            match! Her name was Cindy, a communications major from Nampa Idaho. Ned and Cindy had
            many things in common, they both loved League of Legends, were the same age, and Cindy was
            a great cook (She actually was whereas Ned just thought he was). </div>
        <div class="book-page"> </div>
        <div class="book-page">He finally built up the courage to ask her out and they went on their first date to the
            Nicklecade. It was going really well until Ned realized he had a lab due for 240! What was he
            going to do??? He panicked and told Cindy he had to go because he was feeling sick. He then
            was up all night trying to finish. He scheduled another date with Cindy but then realized he had
            a Calculus test the next day! He had to cancel on her again! Poor Cindy… How was Ned going to
            make it up to her??? Ned realized if he wanted to be happy he would have to change his
            major…</div>
        <div class="book-page"></div>
        <div class="book-page">Today Ned and Cindy are happily married and Ned will graduate next year in Communications.</div>
